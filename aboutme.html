    <h2>Why General Assembly?</h2>
    <p>I first took a programming class in high school, and I both enjoyed it and excelled at it.  It was something I wanted to continue with, so when I went to college I was initially a computer science major.  I found that experience disappointing, because the classes were structured as large lectures with little actual programming, and I ended up switching majors.  However, I still find programming problems challenging and enjoyable, and would like a job where that is a major part of my work.  I selected General Assembly because I learned from my college experience that I learn best in hands-on team environments.  I think that General Assembly&#39s student-centered, practical team approach will work well with my learning style, and I think that I will be a valuable member of the team.  I am looking forward to the dynamic team problem-solving that seems to be a cornerstone of your curriculum. </p>
