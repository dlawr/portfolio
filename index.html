    <h2>Why General Assembly?</h2>
    <p>I first took a programming class in high school; I both enjoyed it and excelled at it.  It was something I wanted to continue with, so when I went to college I was initially a computer science major.  I found that experience disappointing, because the classes were structured as large lectures with little actual programming, and I ended up switching majors.  However, I still find programming problems challenging and enjoyable, and would like a job where that is a major part of my work.  I selected General Assembly because I learned from my college experience that I learn best in hands-on team environments.  I think that General Assembly&#39s student-centered, practical team approach will work well with my learning style, and I think that I will be a valuable member of the team.  I am looking forward to the dynamic team problem-solving that seems to be a cornerstone of your curriculum. </p>

    <h2>Current Employment</h2>
    <p>I am a Mathematics tutor. I currently work at the Center for Academic Excellence and Innovation at Mercy College. In the past I have worked at The Beekman School and the Nord Anglia International School in Manhattan, in addition to significant private tutoring experience.</p>  <p>I have gained a lot from my tutoring experiences, because they have forced me to examine in detail concepts I already knew, which has given me a much deeper understanding of mathematics.  I have also found it particularly gratifying to see my students succeed.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I attended the State University of New York at Albany, where I majored in Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science.  College was a really valuable learning experience for me, in both the academic and personal realms.  Being at a school with large lectures forced me to really examine the way I learn, and inspired me to form study groups and take advantage of collaborative learning opportunities.  In addition, I was a captain of the fencing club and the Japanese Student Association, and I co-founded the UAlbany Breakdancing Club.</p>

    <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
    <p>In college I developed a strong foundation in data structures, discrete math, and algorithms from my college coursework.  After I became interested in web development as a career, I engaged in self-study in JavaScript and Ruby.  </p>
